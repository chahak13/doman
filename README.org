#+title: doman - A small dotfiles manager written in bash
#+author: Chahak Mehta

Doman aims to be a GNU Stow-like dotfiles manager but written in bash. GNU Stow
is a wonderful and huge package that has many wonderful utilities including
being used as a dotfiles manager by providing a utility to symlink all files to
their respective places. My only issue with it is, it is too vast a package be
used as /just/ a dotfiles manager. This led me to start working on doman, with
the aim to be just that, a dotfiles manager and nothing more. Its main functions
comprise of easy symlinking of files from the dotfiles folder to their targets
and easy deletion and handling of the same and it lets version control systems
handle the heavy lifting of syncing with multiple machines.

** Usage

Doman tries to provide a Stow-like interface for linking and determining
targets. For example, doman assumes a dotfiles structure that is similar to:
[[imgs/dotfiles-tree.png]]

Given such a structure, ~doman link vim emacs~ will link ~.vimrc~ to =~/.vimrc=
and ~init.el~ to =~/.config/emacs/init.el=.

** Actions
+ link - Create symlinks to targets
+ remove - Delete all symlinks and target files
+ relink - Delete all existing symlinks and relink all files from the passed files
